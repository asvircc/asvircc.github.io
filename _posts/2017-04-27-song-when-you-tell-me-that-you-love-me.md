I wanna call the stars down from the sky<br>
I wanna live a day that never die<br>
I wanna change the world only for you<br>
All impossible i wanna do<br>


I wanna hold you close under the rain<br>
I wanna kiss you smile and feel your pain<br>
I know what's beautiful looking at you<br>
In a world of lies you are the turth<br>


And baby, everytime you touch me I become a hero<br>
I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you everything you ask for<br>
Nothing is above me<br>
I'm shinning like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me<br>
I wanna make you see just what I was<br>
Show you the loneliness and what it does<br>


You walked into my life to stop my tears<br>
Everythings is easy now<br>
I have you here<br>


And baby, everytime you touch me I become a hero<br>
I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you everything you ask for<br>
Nothing is above me<br>
I'm shining like a candle when you tell me that you love me<br>

In a world without you I would always hunger and I need is you love to take me stronger<br>
Everytime you touch me I become a hero<br>
I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you everything you ask for<br>
Nothing is above me<br>
I'm shining like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me<br>

When you tell me that you love me<br>
When you tell me that you love me<br>
When you tell me that you love me<br>
