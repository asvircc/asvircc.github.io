Dream<br>
Beyond dreams<br>
Beyond life you will find your song<br>
Before sounds to be found close your eyes<br>
Then rise higher still endless thrill<br>
To the land of love<br>
Beyond love<br>
Come alive<br>
Angle eye forever watching you and I<br>

You are the night you are the ocean<br>
You are light behind the cloud<br>
You are the end and the beginning<br>

A world where time is not allowed<br>
There's no such thing as competition<br>
To find a way we lose control<br>
Remeber love's our only mission<br>
This is the journey of soul<br>
The pecfect song is rhythm with silence<br>
It speaks of places never seen<br>
Your home's a promise long forgotten<br>
It is the birthplace of you dreams<br>
