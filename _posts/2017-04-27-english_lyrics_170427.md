I wanna call the stars down from the sky

I wanna live a day that never die

I wanna change the world only for you

All impossible i wanna do

<br>

I wanna hold you close under the rain

I wanna kiss you smile and feel your pain

I know what's beautiful looking at you

In a world of lies you are the turth

<br>

And baby, everytime you touch me I become a hero

I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you everything you ask for

Nothing is above me

I'm shinning like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me

I wanna make you see just what I was

Show you the loneliness and what it does

<br>

You walked into my life to stop my tears

Everythings is easy now

I have you here

<br>

And baby, everytime you touch me I become a hero

I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you everything you ask for

Nothing is above me

I'm shining like a candle when you tell me that you love me

<br>

In a world without you I would always hunger and I need is you love to take me stronger

Everytime you touch me I become a hero

I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you everything you ask for

Nothing is above me

I'm shining like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me

<br>

When you tell me that you love me 

When you tell me that you love me

When you tell me that you love me
